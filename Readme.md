## 🔍 bannerXtract

**bannerXtract** is a lightweight Python tool for banner grabbing — the process of connecting to open TCP ports and retrieving exposed service information. This technique is commonly used in the early stages of penetration testing and ethical hacking.

### 🚀 Features
- Connects to any IP and port combination
- Grabs and displays available banners (e.g., FTP, SSH, HTTP)
- Handles timeouts and connection failures gracefully
- Great for learning how tools like Nmap work under the hood

### ✅ Useful To Understand
- Low-level socket programming
- How banner grabbing aids recon and fingerprinting
- How exposed banners can help identify vulnerable services
